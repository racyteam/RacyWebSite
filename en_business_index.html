              Open market sellers register creators of the RACY platform as influencers to market and sell their products.<br class="pc_br" />
              Sellers can view the creator brand index provided by the RACY platform and sign a contract to register creators that<br class="pc_br" />
              match their products as influencers.

              The contract is automatically concluded by the smart contract, and the link value of the product information provided by the seller is linked with the influencer's ID. Creators can start

              Linked Girl is a model linkage system in which an advertiser selects a creator (model) suitable for their product, content, and brand on the RACY platform and concludes a contract. There
              are various types of model contracts, such as a fashion-related fitting model, a streaming-type product and brand promotion model, and a concept model for a print advertisement, in which
              the creator takes a picture and sends it back to the advertiser.<br /><br />
              Advertisers can select the model they like by checking the quality and content of the creator's content in advance, and they can create advertisements at very low cost without the agent
              cost for general model shooting and manpower for model shooting. Creators can easily shoot using the same camera as their previously uploaded content, and they can provide advertisers
              with content of the concept they want without moving or extra costs and earn profits.

              the seller and the buyer, the RACY platform only provides a trading place and is not responsible for mutual transactions. Therefore, the buyer must make a purchase after clearly
              recognizing the seller's information and reviews as in the general open market.
